# SPEC — AfterBooth

Product requirements (this is our PRD). The API contract is `contract/openapi.yaml` and the data model is `docs/ERD.md`; both are derived from this file.

A surplus equipment hand-off service for events. Equipment left over after festivals, exhibitions and pop-ups (display racks, storage bins, folding tables) goes to the next event or group **before the teardown deadline**.

## Hackathon constraints

- Meta Global AI Developer Hackathon, Indie track, team of two
- Submission deadline 2026-11-05 11:00 KST, team target the evening of 11/4
- Judging: Impact 30% / Use of Meta AI Tooling 25% / Demo 25% / Technical Depth 20%
- All AI in the product runtime uses the Meta Model API: **Muse Spark, SAM 3.1, Muse Voice Transcribe**. No Muse Image
- Development tools (Claude Code, Codex, Muse Code) are disclosed in the README
- To stay clear of discouraged categories (basic RAG, simple image analyzers), AI output always leads to inventory registration, allocation or handover

## Core principle

**AI proposes, the server decides.** The server validates quantity, time and vehicle constraints. The agent can create at most a HOLD; the user confirms.

## Features

### 1. Photo intake (giver)
- Booth photo → **SAM 3.1** segments items one by one and counts them
- **Muse Spark** estimates category, approximate size (cm) and condition from each crop, with a confidence score
- An inventory draft is created → a person reviews, edits and confirms. Low-confidence items are marked "needs review"

### 2. Spoken conditions
- "Teardown by 8, need a van" → **Voice Transcribe** → **Spark** structures it against a JSON schema (`pickupDeadline`, `vehicleType`, `quantity`, `purpose`)
- Returns both the raw transcript and the interpretation

### 3. Pickup request (receiver)
- By voice or text (e.g. "display racks for a weekend event, I only have a sedan")

### 4. Allocation agent
- Spark calls Spring domain tools through function calling: `searchCandidates`, `checkVehicleFit`, `holdQuantity`
- The server validates. When conditions do not match, Spark explains why and offers an alternative in Korean
  - e.g. "높이 180cm라 승용차 불가, 대신 접이식 테이블 3개 어떠세요?" ("180 cm tall, will not fit a sedan. How about 3 folding tables instead?")

### 5. Handover confirmation
- One photo at pickup → SAM counts again → compared with the reserved quantity to complete the handover and record the reused quantity

## Domain

- Organization (seed), Event (seed), Item (category, size, condition, totalQty, availableQty, pickupDeadline, vehicleRequirement), PickupRequest, Reservation, HandoverLog, ReuseStat (a read model over handovers). Tables in `docs/ERD.md`
- Reservation states: `HELD → CONFIRMED → HANDED_OVER`, `HELD|CONFIRMED → RELEASED`, `HELD → EXPIRED`
- Quantity decrement: conditional UPDATE (`available_qty >= :q`); zero affected rows means failure
- Idempotency key on every request. Cancel restores quantity. A scheduler releases holds that expire or pass the teardown deadline
- Vehicle fit: cargo space constants per vehicle type (sedan, SUV, van, 1-ton truck) vs item size → result plus reason code

## Scope

- Minimum: one region, three categories (display rack, storage bin, folding table), direct pickup only, organization accounts as seed data
- Out of scope: maps, notifications, payments, sign-up

## Required tests (Testcontainers)

1. 100 threads request the last 2 → exactly 2 succeed
2. Quantity is restored after cancel or expiry
3. Repeating the same idempotency key never double-decrements
4. Forbidden state transitions are blocked
5. Agent tools cannot bypass server validation

## Screens (Korean UI, mobile first)

1. **Capture and register**: capture with `<input capture>`, box overlay for each detected item, count per category, edit then confirm
2. **Pickup request**: record with MediaRecorder, interpreted condition card, allocation proposal with "why it does not fit + alternative"
3. **Allocation board**: teardown deadline countdown, live remaining quantity (polling), concurrent request results

## Demo scenario

1. Take a photo → "display rack 4, storage bin 12" registered automatically
2. Request pickup by voice
3. Allocation proposal shown
4. Two browsers request the last display rack at the same time → one succeeds, the agent immediately offers the other an alternative
5. Handover completed
6. Reused quantity totaled

Step 1 must appear within the first 15 seconds of the demo video.
